A few days ago, I enterd a div3 contesnt.<br>
It was open at 11:35 p.m. Korean time. so I'm too tired and I entered it late.<br><br>

Anyway, I tried to hard but I could not understand the problme C.<br>
I lacked the skills to understand problems so I think should grow it.<br><br>

It was very  good experience to solve problmes for other competitions.<br><br>

In the future, I have to prepare to solve.<br>
After next entering, I'm gonna post.
