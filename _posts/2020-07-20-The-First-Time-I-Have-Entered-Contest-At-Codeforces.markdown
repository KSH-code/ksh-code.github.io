A few days ago, I enterd a div3 contesnt.
It was open at 11:35 p.m. Korean time. so I'm too tired and I entered it late.

Anyway, I tried to hard but I could not understand the problme C.
I lacked the skills to understand problems so I think should grow it.

It was very  good experience to solve problmes for other competitions.

In the future, I have to prepare to solve.
After next entering, I'm gonna post.
